# Ray-Tracing-Renderer-Development-
This project involves developing a ray tracing renderer in C++. It uses physics simulations to render images from 3D scenes, featuring custom classes for vectors, rays, colors, shapes, and scenes. The Phong lighting model is implemented for realistic ambient, diffuse, specular, and reflective lighting effects.
